# Characterization of exoplanets detection methods with Machine Learning

## Objectives

* Deal with a realistic Machine Learning application 

* Extract and preprocess a real dataset

* Perform a realistic exploratory analysis

* Implement a realistic Machine Learning workflow

* Get an insight to exoplanets detection methods

## Preliminary steps

First, it is advisable to get a basic knowledge about exoplanets detection methods in order to properly interpret the dataset. The following two readings are a good introduction to the concepts we will be handling in this assignment.

* [Five Ways to Find a Planet](https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/5-ways-to-find-a-planet/)

* [Methods of detecting exoplanets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methods_of_detecting_exoplanets)

## Assignment goal

The goal of this assignment is to write a report with a characterization of the exoplanets detection methods based on the analysis of exoplanets data. To achieve this goal it is required to perform a descriptive analysis of the dataset complemented with the development of models able to characterize the detection methods.

## Data adquisition and preprocessing

Download the exoplanet dataset from the [NASA Exploplanet Archive](https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/cgi-bin/TblView/nph-tblView?app=ExoTbls&config=planets). This dataset contains a collection of confirmed exoplanets along with several attributes about them. Download the dataset in CSV format and values-only. You might need to configure your browser to allow the website to open pop-ups.

Once the dataset was downloaded, visualize its header using any tool of your choice (Linux command, text editor, etc) to get info about the dataset attributes names codification.
