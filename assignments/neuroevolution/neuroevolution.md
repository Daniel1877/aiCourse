# Neuroevolutive robot control with the r2p2 robotic simulator

## Objectives

* Implement a full neuroevolutive controller

* Design an ANN topology and an evolutionary algorithm.

This assignment assumes a basic knowledge of ANN, EA and Python programming (Inspyred). Numpy is not a requirement.

## Preliminary steps

This assignment requires the [r2p2 robotic simulator](https://github.com/ISG-UAH/r2p2) properly installed. The [r2p2](https://github.com/ISG-UAH/r2p2) project website contains detailed installation instructions, follow them. The simulator depends on Python 3.x.

## Assignment goal

The goal of this assignment is to develop a neuronal controller for a mobile robot. Basicly, there are two linked tasks to carry out:

1. Design an ANN topology.
2. Train the network through an evolutionary algorithm.

In order to ease the development of this assignment and focus on the important concepts (algorithm design), most of the code is given.

## R2p2 contents

The r2p2 simulator provides almost a full implementation of the neuroevolutive controller with the exception of the critical part that defines the ANN topology (less than one line of code) and its training.

R2p2 provides some interesting configuration files:

* **scenario-neuro.json**: Scenario with a minimalistic track as shown in the figure. Please observe that you can enable or disable the GUI with the parameter *gui*.

* **robot-neuro.json**: Description of the robot used for neuroevolution, by default it contains five sonar sensors.

* **controller-neuro.json**: Neuronal controller configuration.

* **scenario-neuro-simple.json**: Scenario to test a fixed ANN. This scenario serves to observe the robot behavior with an evolved network. It uses the *controller-neuro-simple.json* controller.

* **controller-neuro-simple.json**: Neuronal controller with fixed weights for testing purposes. Please observe that *neurocontroller.py* must have the proper ANN topology. By default it implements a static robot (all zero weights).

You will not need to touch these files, with the exception of the GUI parameter in the scenario configuration and the weights in *controller-neuro-simple.launch*.

You need to touch two files:

* **controller-neuro.json**: This file defines the topology of the hidden layer as a list of integers. The simulator defines a fixed input layer with **five neurons** (which correspond to five sonars) and an output layer with **two neurons** (linear and angular velocities). Please observe that this file also let you define the activation function in the hidden layer (by default tanh) along with the simulation time (15 seconds by default, you should not touch it) and whether this controller is going to be evolved or not.

* **evolution.py**: It must implement the evolutive algorithm which will optimize the network weights (i.e. the robot training). This file contains the implementation of the fitness function (*evaluate_ann()*) that must be used. You must complete this file to implement the optimization algorithm.

A potential source of problems is that the neuronal controller **must receive a vector with the same number of values than weights has the network**, otherwise it will raise an error (numpy will comply that it is unable to reshape an array). Do not forget that the number of weights in the ANN must include the neurons bias. The simulator shows the number of weights to ease debugging.

A tricky issue is how to map the array of weights given to *evaluate_ann()* to the actual weights in the ANN. Fortunately, that is almost irrelevant because the the network will eventually learn where each input and output neuron is connected to.

## Fitness assessment

The fitness is computed as the sum of the distance traveled by the robot, as measured by the odometry. In case of collision with a wall, the evolution is stopped. The scenenario has been configured to run the simulation for 15 seconds, after which the simulation is stopped and the fitness value returned. 

## Neuroevolution execution

In order to train the network you must execute the simulator along with the evolutionary algorithm. From the r2p2 folder, execute the following command:

```Bash
python r2p2.py --scenario ../conf/scenario-neuro.json
```

In another tab, execute the evolutionary algorithm:

```Bash
python evolution.py
```

You should be able to view in real-time the behaviour of the robot if enabled in the configuration file (which is activated by default). Remember that both scripts must work properly in order to evolve the robot behaviour, but the order in which they are run does not matter.

## Evolving the neurocontroller

In order to develop a neurocontroller, there are basically three different tasks:

1. Define the ANN topology. This is done by editing the file *controller-neuro.py*. 
2. Implement the evolutionary algorithm. This is done by editing the file *evolution.py*. Inspyred source code and documentation contains lots of examples to begin with. Remember that the function *evaluate_ann()* already contains the implementation of the fitness function.
3. Train the ANN. Try different parameters in order to determine which ones provide better performance.

You should be able to perform the robot trainning with the following steps from the folder r2p2:

1. Run the simulation (*python r2p2.py --scenario ../conf/scenario-neuro.json*).
3. Run the script that implements the evolution (*python evolution.py*). By defaul this script generates random weights so do not expect a champion robot.

There are some issues you must address.

- ANN topology: Number of layers and number of neurons per layer.

- Init values of network weights.

- Type of EA to implement. You can use any optimization algorithm: GA, ES, SA, or any other.

- EA parameters settings.

- Computational resources are limited, so you must decide whether use many short runs or few long runs.

## Tips 

- Neuroevolution will give you what you request in ways that you do not expect. Enjoy it.

- Disable the GUI to get the best from your (scarce) computational resources.

- Test your network and evolutionary algorithm individually with some na√Øve scenario, only after that try to join them.

- Visualization of the robot behaviour may provide a valuable insight to how the controller is learning, but it requires a lot of computational resources. Use it wisely.

- Once you get a suitable network, you can test that network inserting the weight list in the field *weights* of the file *controller-neuro-simple.json*.

- Try to understand the number of weights needed in the network with paper and pencil.

- Training is quite a heavy task, so any efford to reduce the cost of fitness assessment should pay off.

## Bonus track

Modify the robot perception design (i.e., the number of sonars and their location) to improve the robot behaviour.
