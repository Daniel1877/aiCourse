# Neuroevolutive robot control with the r2p2 robotic simulator

## Objectives

* Integrate an ANN and a EA

* Design an ANN topology

* Implement a full neuroevolutive controller

* Distinguish between ANN and EA parameters.

This assignment assumes a basic knowledge of ANN and EA.

## Preliminary steps

This assignment requires the [r2p2](https://github.com/ISG-UAH/r2p2) properly installed. The [r2p2](https://github.com/ISG-UAH/r2p2) project website contains detailed installation instructions.

## Assignment goal

The goal of this assignment is to develop a neuronal controller for a mobile robot. In order to achive this goal
